This ros package is intended for the kit found here: https://www.adeept.com/adeept-mars-rover-picar-b-wifi-smart-robot-car-kit-for-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-b-2b-speech-recognition-opencv-target-tracking-stem-kit_p0117_s0030.html

The ds4_driver(PS4 ROS Driver) source and installation guides can be found here: http://wiki.ros.org/ds4_driver. 

The tele_ps4_joystick package was created by me to use the information coming from the ps4 controller to control the robot.
